## Dotfiles

Includes generic configuration files for Bash (including prompt customizatioin), Git (including bash completion and utility aliases), and other.

### Usage

Extend your files with anything you need from the provided files.

Probably it would be best to rename the files and let the original files just source these additions. That way the generic logic is kept separate and easy to identify and track.
